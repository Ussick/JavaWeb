With Java EE metadata annotations, the standard web.xml deployment descriptor is now optional. The Servlet 2.5 specification, states annotations can be defined on certain web components, such as servlets, filters, listeners, and tag handlers. The annotations are used to declare dependencies on external resources. The container will detect annotations on such components and inject necessary dependencies before the component’s life-cycle methods are invoked. See WebLogic Annotation for Web Components.
